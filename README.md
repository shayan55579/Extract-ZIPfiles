## Extracting and Saving Files using `os` and `zipfile` Libraries in Python

In Python, you can use the `os` and `zipfile` libraries to extract and save files from a ZIP archive. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import os
import zipfile
```
2. Specify the path to the ZIP archive:
```python
os.chdir('E:\TA Filoger\Solving\Test\Ex07')
```
3.Extract and Save the file
```python
zip_file.extractall(r'C:\Users\Shayan\Desktop\fi') # folder that saves files
```


Please note that the provided Markdown code is a descriptive explanation of how to extract and save files using the `os` and `zipfile` libraries in Python. To actually implement the extraction logic, you would need to write Python code and utilize the appropriate functions and methods from the `os` and `zipfile` libraries.
